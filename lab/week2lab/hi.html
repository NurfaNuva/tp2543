					<!-- about yourself here -->
					Hi, my name is Fakhrul. This is my page for my web programming course. I have to say something about myself even thought it's quite hard because you know better about yourself and do not know where to start. Ok, let's give a shot to describe simple and short about myself.<br><br>
					One way to describe myself is relaxing. The way of life and how myself conduct is to always relax whenever we are. Of course it easier said than done, but stressing ourself is not the right answer. So, I like to see where life take me whether meet a fateful person or a situation that will change my life. The wonder feeling each time i had make me really thankful for the others around me and enjoy the little time we had. That's all that i like to share in this page.<br>
